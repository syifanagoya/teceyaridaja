Over the past four decades, the Virginia native not only transformed the four-story brownstone into a collection of artist studios, but she also succeeded in cultivating a true safe haven for scores of creatives from near and far. Quirky building bones aside, what makes this space so unique is its owner — an altruistic den mother, more interested in fostering a collaborative culture among her tenants than anything else. "I'm not a money-motivated person," says Ballentine. "For me, it's about happiness. It makes me happy when people have talent and work hard. When they are doing well, I am just proud of them."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ormond Gigli’s photo <i>Girls in the Windows</i>, shot in Manhattan in 1960.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Between the coronavirus pandemic and the continued civil unrest across America this year, it may seem as if there is not much cause for celebration. And yet there are signs of solidarity everywhere, including among this patchwork family bound by their love of art and New York City. Here, as an homage to famed photographer Ormond Gigli's iconic 1960s image, Girls in the Windows, the tenants stand tall together in vibrant color, reminding us of the life that still goes on inside all of our homes and how powerful we can be when we are united.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Schmidt/Bernstein & Andriulli</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1.

Now back in N.Y.C., she says, "Every time we go through something, I feel a sense of solidarity with everyone around me. I missed that.
