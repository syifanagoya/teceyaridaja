We all agree, right?&nbsp;He has passed for 4,000 yards numerous times and guided two separate teams to Super Bowl losses (and one triumph). Fans are clamoring to know Kurt Warner net worth. Let’s find out!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=what-is-kurt-warners-net-worth>What Is Kurt Warner’s Net Worth?</h2><p>With the numbers to back it up, Warner is regarded as one of the best football players. Warner participated in the NFL for 12 seasons. Clutch Points estimates Kurt Warner’s net worth to be $30 million as of 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=who-is-kurt-warner-early-life>Who Is Kurt Warner? [Early Life]</h2><p>Kurtis Eugene “Kurt” Warner, a former American football quarterback, was born in Burlington, Iowa, on June 22, 1971. After the 2009 season, he left the sport. The Green Bay Packers hired him as an undrafted free agent in 1994. He competed with the Panthers of Northern Iowa in college sports. Kurt finished his education at Regis High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he played quarterback for the Class 3A football team. In 1989, he graduated from high school and enrolled at the University of Northern Iowa.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=career>Career</h2><p>Warner was an undrafted free agent after his college career in the 1994 NFL Draft. In 1994, he was allowed to try out for the Green Bay Packers training camp but was cut before the regular season started. After being freed, Warner earned $5.50 per hour, stocking shelves at a Hy-Vee supermarket in Cedar Falls. When describing his ascent to NFL greatness in 1999, Warner frequently used this as his point of departure. He also claims that in or around 1997, his commitment to Christianity grew. While still trying to earn another audition with an NFL organization. Warner persisted in his involvement with professional football, rising to the position of graduate assistant coach at Northern Iowa. He joined the Arena Football League in 1995, playing for the Iowa Barnstormers. He immediately rose to prominence in the league, guiding Iowa to two straight appearances in the Arena Bowl.</p><p>The St. Louis Rams signed Warner, which caught their notice due to this success. Kurt then briefly played in the NFL Europe before returning to the US. Like his first several seasons at Northern Iowa, Warner was forced to serve as the backup quarterback. After the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft, the starting lineup was altered, and Warner unexpectedly found himself behind Trent Green as the backup quarterback. When Green suffered an ACL tear, Warner received the starting job he had been hoping for.</p><p>The league was in disbelief at his performance. He finished with 4,353 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and a 65.1% completion rate. The Rams’ offense acquired the moniker “The Greatest Show on Turf,” and they stormed to a Super Bowl win that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Warner agreed to a $47 million contract with the Rams in 2000. Unfortunately, Warner broke his hand midway through the season. Trent Green filled in, and the two helped the Rams amass 5,232&nbsp;passing yards, which is the most in NFL history. Kurt led the group to the Super Bowl one more time in 2001, but they were unsuccessful in taking home the trophy. He did, however, succeed in winning his second NFL MVP Award that year.</p><p>In 2005, he joined the Arizona Cardinals. Coach Dennis Green exhibited complete confidence in his new quarterback and gave him a $4 million one-year contract. Warner was allowed to play, but after three underwhelming appearances, he was swiftly replaced. He was reinstated into the starting lineup, though, and he defeated the Rams 38-28 with three touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 115.9.</p><p>This prompted the Cardinals to agree to a three-year, $18 million contract extension. Over the following several years, he put up strong performances, and in 2008, he helped the Cardinals reach the Super Bowl. Warner formally retired in 2010 after a poor 2009 hit.</p><p>Kurt Warner became the only individual to be recognized in both the Arena Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 5, 2017, when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=personal-life>Personal Life</h2><p>He initially encountered Brenda Carney Meoni as he was finishing up his degree. They both began dating and were married on October 11, 1997, the anniversary of their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>His wife was a former corporal in the US Marine Corps. Additionally, she was married and the mother of two children from her first union. One of her children is now blind and mentally damaged. She filed for divorce from her first husband in 1990.</p><p>In 1996, a tornado struck her parents’ home in Mountain View, Arkansas, killing them. Following their marriage, Kurt Warner fostered Brenda’s two children, and they gave birth to five more children.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Interesting Facts About Kurt Warner&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When a tornado hit their house in 1996, Larry and Jenny Carney, his wife’s parents, perished.&nbsp;</li><li>During his final year in Northern Iowa, he first met his wife, Brenda Warner, at a dance club.&nbsp;</li><li>In 2001, he received his second Super Bowl&nbsp;MVP Award.</li><li>He has seven children.&nbsp;</li><li>He once worked in a grocery shop for $5.50 per hour.</li><li>Warner was the quarterback for Regis in Cedar Rapids.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=section_1></h2><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=conclusion>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><p>As of August 2022, Kurt Warner’s net worth is $30 million.
