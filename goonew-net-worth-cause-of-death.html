Let’s find out.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p><br>Markelle Antonio Morrow was born on May 14, 1997, in a rough neighborhood in Maryland.</p><p>He didn’t know much about his father, but he was raised by his mom, Patrice Parker Morrow, and grew up with his sister Ariana.</p><p>The family moved quite a lot, spending time in Gainesville and Clearwater, Florida, Washington, DC, and Martinsburg, West Virginia—before returning to District Heights in Maryland.</p><p>School was sporadic for Morrow, although he was largely credited as being a “smart kid.”</p><p>What Markelle Morrow really wanted, though, wasn’t in any school books.</p><p>He wanted a way to provide for his family.</p><p>Even after his untimely death, Patrice Parker Morrow would tell media outlets that “all he wanted to do is try to get his family out the hood.”</p><h2><strong>Rise and Fall</strong></h2><p><br>Goonew was a sociable guy, and what he lacked in experience, he more than made up for in connections.</p><p>He built up relationships with fellow rapper Lil Dude, who was also from the DMV area.</p><p>Fast fact: The DMV area stands for District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia—and is known as the National Capital Region.</p><p>Morrow and Lil Dude—who was already making a name for himself on the local hip-hop scene—teamed up to make a mixtape.</p><p>The mixtape, titled Homicide Boat, fell into the hands of another rapper: Lil Yachty.</p><p><a href=#>Lil Yachty</a> began collaborating with Goonew as a young up and comer, giving him more exposure and an opportunity to prove his worth on stage. The move was a savvy one, and in the summer of 2018, Morrow released his first album.</p><p>More hits would come, including Big 64, Goonrich Urkel, Still Servin, and several official music videos which have been viewed millions of time across social media.</p><p>And then, suddenly, it was all over.</p><p>On March 18, 2022, the Prince George County Police Department was called to a shooting in a District Heights parking lot.</p><p>Markelle had been mugged and shot.</p><p>Within several hours of the 5:40 pm shooting, Morrow had passed away at a local hospital, and police were offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of his killer.</p><p>Markelle’s mother said he had gone out to drop off a present for his sister.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>J $tash Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>That Funeral</strong></h2><p><br>Goonew was about to make headlines one more time—and this time, he was going international.</p><p>His family—with the blessing of his mom, Patrice, and his sister, Ariana—booked a Washington, DC, nightclub to hold the late rapper’s memorial service.</p><p>What they didn’t tell the venue, Bliss Nightclub, was that they would be bringing his embalmed body into the club and propping it up on stage.</p><p>Global media outlets reported on the very unique event, prompting the Morrow family to respond on social media.</p><p>Patrice said at the time:</p><p>“I’m pleased with how I sent my son away. I wish people would just let me grieve in peace.”</p><p>Displaying the body of a deceased loved one is not unheard of—although displaying it in a nightclub may be the problematic part.</p><p>Many cultures—like the Hindu, Maori, and some areas of Ghana—hold days-long ceremonies with an open casket.</p><h2><strong>Goonew – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much was Goonew worth?</p><p>Morrow earned most of his wealth from selling copies of his albums and mixtapes, including — Goonwick, Certified Goon, and Big 64.</p><p>Therefore, at the time of his death, Goonew had an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>What is Almighty Jay’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfnLywusSwZKedpGLEsL7ToWScmaWosm67xWabnpmknXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html&text=Goonew%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Cause%20of%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html&title=Goonew%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html&title=Goonew%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html&title=Goonew%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgoonew-net-worth-cause-of-death.html&description=Goonew%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elvis-fascinating-habit-involving-cadillacs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elvis Had A Fascinating Habit Involving Cadillacs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./woo-do-hwan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eternal Monarch actor Woo Do-Hwan dating?
